chartHelpPage.title = Help for charts
chartHelpPage.send_save = With "send" you can request a chart. If anything is incorrect with the information you have chosen, it will display an error message. If you have requested a chart, you can download it to your computer with the "download" button.
chartHelpPage.save = You will be displayed a pop up, where you can enter a name for the download file. This is optional, the standard name is "chart". You can choose to either download the chart in png image format or as svg graphic.
chartHelpPage.selection = The selection
chartHelpPage.time = Here you can choose a time period by which the data will be filtered. If you don't choose anything, the data will not be filtered by time.	You do not have to select everything, for example if you just want to filter by a year, you only choose the year. But if you want to filter by a day, you also have to provide the years and months to filter.
chartHelpPage.axis = Here you can choose which attribute is displayed as the x-axis (y-axis looks similar). You first choose the dimension and subsequently the level from this dimension to display. To request a chart, this information has to be privided.
chartHelpPage.measure = In this selection box you choose a measure and an aggregation.
chartHelpPage.measureElapsed = elapsed: the time from request until the answer from the server
chartHelpPage.measureBusy = busy: the time the cpu was busy with the request
chartHelpPage.measureRows = rows: the number of rows accessed
chartHelpPage.measureAggregations = the aggregation types are # of accesses, sum, maximum and average
chartHelpPage.dimensions = In these boxes, you can select the filters for the different dimensions. If you choose values and there are sublevels, they will fade in, so you can choose them too. Only the deepest level chosen in a box will be filtered.
chartHelpPage.dimensionsExample = For example: if you choose two countries and in one country you choose two cities, only this cities will be filtered.
